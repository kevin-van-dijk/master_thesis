# master_thesis
This repo hosts the code used for my thesis experiments.

The code merily serves as an addition to my Master thesis.
The code is not cleaned up nor will it be maintained in the future.
It can serve as an inspiration or reference for other people in the future.

Most of the code is based on the following three repo's:

  1. https://github.com/jayleicn/TVQAplus
  2. https://github.com/jayleicn/tvretrieval
  3. https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
